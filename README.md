Personal Portfolio Using HTML and CSS 

For this project, I designed and developed a personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS. The main purpose of this website is to showcase my skills, projects, services, and provide a way for potential employers or clients to contact me. I used VS code —a mobile-friendly code editor that supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript development—for building and testing the site. This tool allowed me to write code and preview my work directly on my Android device, making it convenient and efficient.

The website consists of five main pages: Home, About, Portfolio, Services, and Contact. Each page is structured using clean semantic HTML and styled with custom CSS to ensure a consistent and modern design throughout the site.

The Home page serves as the introduction to the website. It includes a welcome message, my name, profession, and a navigation bar at the top. The navigation bar provides links to the other sections and is designed to be responsive, with hover effects and smooth transitions to enhance the user experience.

The About page gives a detailed overview of who I am. It contains information about my background, education, and goals as a web developer or designer. I used paragraph elements to present the text and styled them using CSS to manage spacing, font styles, and layout.

The Portfolio page is dedicated to showcasing my previous work or personal projects. Each project is displayed as a card with a thumbnail image, title, and short description. I used a grid layout in CSS to organize the cards, and hover effects to make the page more interactive. This section highlights my creativity, technical skills, and ability to complete real-world tasks.

The Services page lists the different services I offer, such as website development, UI/UX design, or maintenance. Each service is represented with an icon or image, a title, and a short explanation. I used flexbox in CSS to align the content neatly and ensure it looks good on different screen sizes.

The Contact page provides a form where visitors can enter their name, email, and a message. Although the form is not connected to a backend, it demonstrates my understanding of form elements in HTML. 

Throughout the entire site, I applied consistent color schemes, font choices, and layout principles using CSS. I also used media queries to ensure that the design is responsive and works well on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.

Building this portfolio in VS Code gave me valuable experience in writing and organizing HTML and CSS code in a mobile environment. It improved my confidence in designing user interfaces and deepened my understanding of responsive web design. This portfolio not only serves as a personal brand but also as a practical demonstration of my technical abilities.
